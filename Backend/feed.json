      "description": "Governments from around the world have pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change. The pledges were made at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The goal of the conference was to reach an agreement that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. While the pledges made at the conference are a step in the right direction, they are not enough to meet the 1.5 degree Celsius goal. More action is needed from governments and businesses in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
